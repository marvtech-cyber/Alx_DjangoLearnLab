Step 1: Set Custom Permissions

Define specific permissions for a Book model in the models.py file. This includes permissions to view, create, edit, and delete books.
Step 2: Create Views with Permissions

Create views for the Book model that require specific permissions to access. For example, only users with the "can_view" permission can view books, and only users with the "can_create" permission can create new books.
Step 3: Create Groups

Create groups in the admin panel, such as "Editors", "Viewers", and "Admins".
Step 4: Assign Permissions to Groups

Assign specific permissions to each group. For example, the "Editors" group might have the "can_edit" permission, while the "Viewers" group might have the "can_view" permission.
Step 5: Assign Users to Groups

Assign specific users to each group. This determines which users have access to which permissions and can perform specific actions on the Book model.
By following these steps, you can control who can do what with your Book model, ensuring that only authorized users can view, create, edit, or delete books.
