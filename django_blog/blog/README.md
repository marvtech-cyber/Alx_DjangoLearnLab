Authentication Documentation

The authentication system in this application is designed to provide a secure and user-friendly way for users to register, log in, and manage their profiles. Here's a detailed breakdown of the authentication process:

Registration

User Registration Form: The user registration form is handled by the UserRegistrationForm class, which is defined in the forms.py file. This form requires the user to provide a username, email address, and password.
Registration View: The registration view is handled by the register function, which is defined in the views.py file. This function creates a new user instance and saves it to the database.
User Profile Creation: When a new user is created, a corresponding profile instance is also created using the Profile model. This profile instance is associated with the user instance.
Login

Login Form: The login form is handled by the AuthenticationForm class, which is defined in the django.contrib.auth.forms module. This form requires the user to provide a username and password.
Login View: The login view is handled by the login function, which is defined in the views.py file. This function authenticates the user using the authenticate function and logs them in using the login function.
Profile Management

Profile View: The profile view is handled by the profile_view function, which is defined in the views.py file. This function displays the user's profile information.
Edit Profile View: The edit profile view is handled by the edit_profile_view function, which is defined in the views.py file. This function allows the user to edit their profile information.
Authentication Decorators

Login Required: The @login_required decorator is used to restrict access to certain views, such as the profile and edit profile views, to logged-in users only.
User Passes Test: The UserPassesTestMixin mixin is used to restrict access to certain views, such as the post update and delete views, to users who own the post.

Register a new user: Visit the /register URL and fill out the registration form.
Log in as the new user: Visit the /login URL and enter the username and password.
